# Ticket booking application

## 📌 Overview
This is a ticket booking application built using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL (in-memory)**, and **Redis**. It provides a seamless experience for booking tickets, canceling tickets, and processing reservations efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- User authentication and authorization (Sign-up, Login)
- Ticket booking and cancellation
- Real-time availability checking
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- In-memory MySQL database for fast operations
- - **End-to-End Encryption** for request and response security
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user access
- **Data encryption & decryption** to prevent data breaches in transit

## 🔐 Security Implementations
1. **JWT Authentication**  
   - The application uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure user authentication.  
   - Each request requires a valid JWT token to access protected routes.

2. **End-to-End Encryption**  
   - All incoming requests are encrypted before reaching the server.  
   - The server **decrypts the request**, processes it, and then **encrypts the response** before sending it back.  
   - This prevents **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** and ensures **data integrity**.

3. **Secure Environment Variables**  
   - Sensitive credentials (e.g., database connection, API keys) are stored in a `.env` file and never hardcoded.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL (In-Memory)
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Validation**: Joi
- **Encryption**: AES-256
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
